You will see a blank graph upon opening the program.

Go to File -> Open
Select the *directory* containing all of the data xmls.
All of the data will be read in. This may take a few seconds.

The right hand checkboxes allow you to select multiple stats to be graphed. They can 
    be selected and unselected.

The radio buttons on the left hand allow the user to view the graph in different ranges:
    By years, months, weeks, or days.

The arrows below the graph allow the user to pan through the data. Depending on the
    left hand selection of the view, the graph will pan by year, month, week, and
    day respectively.

Stats about the data in view to the user is shown in the table below. For example, if
    the year radio button is chosen and the view is of 2010, the stats will reflect the
    year 2010. This applies to the other combinations as well.

The user can hover their mouse over the data in the graph. After a moment, a tool tip will
    appear and reveal statistics about that point in the graph:
        Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed, Windgust, Windchill, 
        UV Index, Heat Index, Barometer, and Rainfall.

The user can close the program by selecting File -> Exit, or by pressing the 'x' in the 
    upper right corner of the window.
